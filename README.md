# COVIDbot

A crawler to collect information on how **you** can stay **healthy** and **protect yourself** at home during the COVID-19 outbreak. 

This includes information on immunity, nutrition, sleep, rest, avoiding infection and exposure, staying fit and finding a productive daily routine.
It is supposed to collect information on what **you** can do, rather than what is happening outside.

Initially, this project is intended to crawl the web from
*  handpicked sources,
*  topics,
*  experts,
*  government resources and
*  public information websites.

Operating locally initially, the crawler will be **hosted** and run in real-time as a second step, providing a news feed of actionable information to stay healthy. A daily digest, customized feed (personalized or on topics) or mail/newsletter could expand the reach and usability of the crawler.

Beyond this, crawled information should be stored in a **searchable database**, relating each topic to experts as well as public and government info. 
Ultimately, this could grow into a **knowledge graph** / database indexing information to provide a easily searchable resource for how to stay healthy.


## Getting Started

Right now, COVIDbot only exists as an idea. Making it a reality is being worked on right now, and we need your help!
The path to success mirrors the steps outlined above:
* Build a crawler
* Host it online & expand it
* Build a feed/digest
* Store crawled information in a database
* Make database searchable
* (Build knowledge graph on top of database)
* (Build a chat bot to make it easily accessible)

Each step builds on & necessitates previous steps, and the first step is building a crawler and making it available! 
If you are interested in contributing & building this project with us, please do - all kind of help is needed and greatly appreciated! 

## Tools
This project will be written in Python. 
NLP (with spacy?) will be used to process and filter crawled content. 


Candidate Tools for various aspects include: 
- Jupyter Notebooks during experimental period
- NLP: spacy 
- environment: docker & conda
- database: elastic
